		Protect the person from injury-<br>
	Keep him or her from falling if you can, or try to guide the person gently to the floor. Try to move furniture or other objects that might injure the person during the seizure. If the person is having a seizure and is on the ground when you arrive, try to position the person on his or her side so that fluid can leak out of the mouth. But be careful not to apply too much pressure to the <a href="index_12.html">body</a>.
