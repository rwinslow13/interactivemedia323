		<div class="head two">This day started like any other, I got dressed, went to school, came home, and played with our new dog, but on this day my life changed forever. After this day I would never here a crashing noise and think nothing of it, or here a thump from upstairs and not call out my sister's name to double check that she was ok. I would never be able to stop watching her every movement, not after this day. On this day, our parents went to a hotel for a stay-cation and my sister and I stayed home, to watch movies, eat pizza, and most likely do our nails. We went to our friends down the street to borrow some movies and on our way back, my life changed <a href="index_2.html">forever.</a> </div>
